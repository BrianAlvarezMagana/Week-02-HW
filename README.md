# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

# Portfolio Brian Alvarez

## Usage

For future employers to be able to see my experience and coding abilities in a very neat and concise website.

## Description

The Portfolio I have created has a section for a small blurb about myself and my backgorund and goals in this field, my previous work and projects I have completed, 
and a section on where and how to reach / contact me.
